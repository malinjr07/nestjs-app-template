### RabbitMQ

[RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) is an open-source and lightweight message broker which supports multiple messaging protocols. It can be deployed in distributed and federated configurations to meet high-scale, high-availability requirements. In addition, it's the most widely deployed message broker, used worldwide at small startups and large enterprises.

#### Installation[#](https://docs.nestjs.com/microservices/rabbitmq#installation)

To start building RabbitMQ-based microservices, first install the required packages:

```lua
$ npm i --save amqplib amqp-connection-manager
```

#### Overview[#](https://docs.nestjs.com/microservices/rabbitmq#overview)

To use the RabbitMQ transporter, pass the following options object to the `createMicroservice()` method:

main.ts

JS

```yaml
const app = await NestFactory.createMicroservice<MicroserviceOptions>(AppModule, {
  transport: Transport.RMQ,
  options: {
    urls: ['amqp://localhost:5672'],
    queue: 'cats_queue',
    queueOptions: {
      durable: false
    },
  },
});
```

> **Hint** The `Transport` enum is imported from the `@nestjs/microservices` package.

#### Options[#](https://docs.nestjs.com/microservices/rabbitmq#options)

The `options` property is specific to the chosen transporter. The **RabbitMQ** transporter exposes the properties described below.

#### Client[#](https://docs.nestjs.com/microservices/rabbitmq#client)

Like other microservice transporters, you have [several options](https://docs.nestjs.com/microservices/basics#client) for creating a RabbitMQ `ClientProxy` instance.

One method for creating an instance is to use the `ClientsModule`. To create a client instance with the `ClientsModule`, import it and use the `register()` method to pass an options object with the same properties shown above in the `createMicroservice()` method, as well as a `name` property to be used as the injection token. Read more about `ClientsModule`[here](https://docs.nestjs.com/microservices/basics#client).

```less
@Module({
  imports: [
    ClientsModule.register([
      {
        name: 'MATH_SERVICE',
        transport: Transport.RMQ,
        options: {
          urls: ['amqp://localhost:5672'],
          queue: 'cats_queue',
          queueOptions: {
            durable: false
          },
        },
      },
    ]),
  ]
  ...
})
```

Other options to create a client (either `ClientProxyFactory` or `@Client()`) can be used as well. You can read about them [here](https://docs.nestjs.com/microservices/basics#client).

#### Context[#](https://docs.nestjs.com/microservices/rabbitmq#context)

In more complex scenarios, you may need to access additional information about the incoming request. When using the RabbitMQ transporter, you can access the `RmqContext` object.

JS

```less
@MessagePattern('notifications')
getNotifications(@Payload() data: number[], @Ctx() context: RmqContext) {
  console.log(`Pattern: ${context.getPattern()}`);
}
```

> **Hint**`@Payload()`, `@Ctx()` and `RmqContext` are imported from the `@nestjs/microservices` package.

To access the original RabbitMQ message (with the `properties`, `fields`, and `content`), use the `getMessage()` method of the `RmqContext` object, as follows:

JS

```less
@MessagePattern('notifications')
getNotifications(@Payload() data: number[], @Ctx() context: RmqContext) {
  console.log(context.getMessage());
}
```

To retrieve a reference to the RabbitMQ [channel](https://www.rabbitmq.com/channels.html), use the `getChannelRef` method of the `RmqContext` object, as follows:

JS

```less
@MessagePattern('notifications')
getNotifications(@Payload() data: number[], @Ctx() context: RmqContext) {
  console.log(context.getChannelRef());
}
```

#### Message acknowledgement[#](https://docs.nestjs.com/microservices/rabbitmq#message-acknowledgement)

To make sure a message is never lost, RabbitMQ supports [message acknowledgements](https://www.rabbitmq.com/confirms.html). An acknowledgement is sent back by the consumer to tell RabbitMQ that a particular message has been received, processed and that RabbitMQ is free to delete it. If a consumer dies (its channel is closed, connection is closed, or TCP connection is lost) without sending an ack, RabbitMQ will understand that a message wasn't processed fully and will re-queue it.

To enable manual acknowledgment mode, set the `noAck` property to `false`:

```yaml
options: {
  urls: ['amqp://localhost:5672'],
  queue: 'cats_queue',
  noAck: false,
  queueOptions: {
    durable: false
  },
},
```

When manual consumer acknowledgements are turned on, we must send a proper acknowledgement from the worker to signal that we are done with a task.

JS

```typescript
@MessagePattern('notifications')
getNotifications(@Payload() data: number[], @Ctx() context: RmqContext) {
  const channel = context.getChannelRef();
  const originalMsg = context.getMessage();

  channel.ack(originalMsg);
}
```

#### Record builders[#](https://docs.nestjs.com/microservices/rabbitmq#record-builders)

To configure message options, you can use the `RmqRecordBuilder` class (note: this is doable for event-based flows as well). For example, to set `headers` and `priority` properties, use the `setOptions` method, as follows:

```php
const message = ':cat:';
const record = new RmqRecordBuilder(message)
  .setOptions({
    headers: {
      ['x-version']: '1.0.0',
    },
    priority: 3,
  })
  .build();

this.client.send('replace-emoji', record).subscribe(...);
```

> **Hint**`RmqRecordBuilder` class is exported from the `@nestjs/microservices` package.

And you can read these values on the server-side as well, by accessing the `RmqContext`, as follows:

JS

```kotlin
@MessagePattern('replace-emoji')
replaceEmoji(@Payload() data: string, @Ctx() context: RmqContext): string {
  const { properties: { headers } } = context.getMessage();
  return headers['x-version'] === '1.0.0' ? '🐱' : '🐈';
}
```

#### Instance status updates[#](https://docs.nestjs.com/microservices/rabbitmq#instance-status-updates)

To get real-time updates on the connection and the state of the underlying driver instance, you can subscribe to the `status` stream. This stream provides status updates specific to the chosen driver. For the RMQ driver, the `status` stream emits `connected` and `disconnected` events.

```javascript
this.client.status.subscribe((status: RmqStatus) => {
  console.log(status);
});
```

> **Hint** The `RmqStatus` type is imported from the `@nestjs/microservices` package.

Similarly, you can subscribe to the server's `status` stream to receive notifications about the server's status.

```javascript
const server = app.connectMicroservice<MicroserviceOptions>(...);
server.status.subscribe((status: RmqStatus) => {
  console.log(status);
});
```

#### Listening to RabbitMQ events[#](https://docs.nestjs.com/microservices/rabbitmq#listening-to-rabbitmq-events)

In some cases, you might want to listen to internal events emitted by the microservice. For example, you could listen for the `error` event to trigger additional operations when an error occurs. To do this, use the `on()` method, as shown below:

```javascript
this.client.on('error', (err) => {
  console.error(err);
});
```

Similarly, you can listen to the server's internal events:

```javascript
server.on<RmqEvents>('error', (err) => {
  console.error(err);
});
```

> **Hint** The `RmqEvents` type is imported from the `@nestjs/microservices` package.

#### Underlying driver access[#](https://docs.nestjs.com/microservices/rabbitmq#underlying-driver-access)

For more advanced use cases, you may need to access the underlying driver instance. This can be useful for scenarios like manually closing the connection or using driver-specific methods. However, keep in mind that for most cases, you **shouldn't need** to access the driver directly.

To do so, you can use the `unwrap()` method, which returns the underlying driver instance. The generic type parameter should specify the type of driver instance you expect.

```kotlin
const managerRef =
  this.client.unwrap<import('amqp-connection-manager').AmqpConnectionManager>();
```

Similarly, you can access the server's underlying driver instance:

```go
const managerRef =
  server.unwrap<import('amqp-connection-manager').AmqpConnectionManager>();
```

#### Wildcards[#](https://docs.nestjs.com/microservices/rabbitmq#wildcards)

RabbitMQ supports the use of wildcards in routing keys to allow for flexible message routing. The `#` wildcard matches zero or more words, while the `*` wildcard matches exactly one word.

For example, the routing key `cats.#` matches `cats`, `cats.meow`, and `cats.meow.purr`. The routing key `cats.*` matches `cats.meow` but not `cats.meow.purr`.

To enable wildcard support in your RabbitMQ microservice, set the `wildcards` configuration option to `true` in the options object:

```yaml
const app = await NestFactory.createMicroservice<MicroserviceOptions>(
  AppModule,
  {
    transport: Transport.RMQ,
    options: {
      urls: ['amqp://localhost:5672'],
      queue: 'cats_queue',
      wildcards: true,
    },
  },
);
```

With this configuration, you can use wildcards in your routing keys when subscribing to events/messages. For example, to listen for messages with the routing key `cats.#`, you can use the following code:

```less
@MessagePattern('cats.#')
getCats(@Payload() data: { message: string }, @Ctx() context: RmqContext) {
  console.log(`Received message with routing key: ${context.getPattern()}`);

  return {
    message: 'Hello from the cats service!',
  }
}
```

To send a message with a specific routing key, you can use the `send()` method of the `ClientProxy` instance:

```javascript
this.client.send('cats.meow', { message: 'Meow!' }).subscribe((response) => {
  console.log(response);
});
```
