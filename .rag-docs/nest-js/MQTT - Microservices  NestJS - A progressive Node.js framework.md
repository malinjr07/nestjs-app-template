### MQTT

[MQTT](https://mqtt.org/) (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) is an open source, lightweight messaging protocol, optimized for low latency. This protocol provides a scalable and cost-efficient way to connect devices using a **publish/subscribe** model. A communication system built on MQTT consists of the publishing server, a broker and one or more clients. It is designed for constrained devices and low-bandwidth, high-latency or unreliable networks.

#### Installation[#](https://docs.nestjs.com/microservices/mqtt#installation)

To start building MQTT-based microservices, first install the required package:

```lua
$ npm i --save mqtt
```

#### Overview[#](https://docs.nestjs.com/microservices/mqtt#overview)

To use the MQTT transporter, pass the following options object to the `createMicroservice()` method:

main.ts

JS

```rust
const app = await NestFactory.createMicroservice<MicroserviceOptions>(AppModule, {
  transport: Transport.MQTT,
  options: {
    url: 'mqtt://localhost:1883',
  },
});
```

> **Hint** The `Transport` enum is imported from the `@nestjs/microservices` package.

#### Options[#](https://docs.nestjs.com/microservices/mqtt#options)

The `options` object is specific to the chosen transporter. The **MQTT** transporter exposes the properties described [here](https://github.com/mqttjs/MQTT.js/#mqttclientstreambuilder-options).

#### Client[#](https://docs.nestjs.com/microservices/mqtt#client)

Like other microservice transporters, you have [several options](https://docs.nestjs.com/microservices/basics#client) for creating a MQTT `ClientProxy` instance.

One method for creating an instance is to use use the `ClientsModule`. To create a client instance with the `ClientsModule`, import it and use the `register()` method to pass an options object with the same properties shown above in the `createMicroservice()` method, as well as a `name` property to be used as the injection token. Read more about `ClientsModule`[here](https://docs.nestjs.com/microservices/basics#client).

```less
@Module({
  imports: [
    ClientsModule.register([
      {
        name: 'MATH_SERVICE',
        transport: Transport.MQTT,
        options: {
          url: 'mqtt://localhost:1883',
        }
      },
    ]),
  ]
  ...
})
```

Other options to create a client (either `ClientProxyFactory` or `@Client()`) can be used as well. You can read about them [here](https://docs.nestjs.com/microservices/basics#client).

#### Context[#](https://docs.nestjs.com/microservices/mqtt#context)

In more complex scenarios, you may need to access additional information about the incoming request. When using the MQTT transporter, you can access the `MqttContext` object.

JS

```less
@MessagePattern('notifications')
getNotifications(@Payload() data: number[], @Ctx() context: MqttContext) {
  console.log(`Topic: ${context.getTopic()}`);
}
```

> **Hint**`@Payload()`, `@Ctx()` and `MqttContext` are imported from the `@nestjs/microservices` package.

To access the original mqtt [packet](https://github.com/mqttjs/mqtt-packet), use the `getPacket()` method of the `MqttContext` object, as follows:

JS

```less
@MessagePattern('notifications')
getNotifications(@Payload() data: number[], @Ctx() context: MqttContext) {
  console.log(context.getPacket());
}
```

#### Wildcards[#](https://docs.nestjs.com/microservices/mqtt#wildcards)

A subscription may be to an explicit topic, or it may include wildcards. Two wildcards are available, `+` and `#`. `+` is a single-level wildcard, while `#` is a multi-level wildcard which covers many topic levels.

JS

```less
@MessagePattern('sensors/+/temperature/+')
getTemperature(@Ctx() context: MqttContext) {
  console.log(`Topic: ${context.getTopic()}`);
}
```

#### Quality of Service (QoS)[#](https://docs.nestjs.com/microservices/mqtt#quality-of-service-qos)

Any subscription created with `@MessagePattern` or `@EventPattern` decorators will subscribe with QoS 0. If a higher QoS is required, it can be set globally using the `subscribeOptions` block when establishing the connection as follows:

main.ts

JS

```yaml
const app = await NestFactory.createMicroservice<MicroserviceOptions>(AppModule, {
  transport: Transport.MQTT,
  options: {
    url: 'mqtt://localhost:1883',
    subscribeOptions: {
      qos: 2
    },
  },
});
```

If a topic specific QoS is required, consider creating a [Custom transporter](https://docs.nestjs.com/microservices/custom-transport).

#### Record builders[#](https://docs.nestjs.com/microservices/mqtt#record-builders)

To configure message options (adjust the QoS level, set the Retain or DUP flags, or add additional properties to the payload), you can use the `MqttRecordBuilder` class. For example, to set `QoS` to `2` use the `setQoS` method, as follows:

```go
const userProperties = { 'x-version': '1.0.0' };
const record = new MqttRecordBuilder(':cat:')
  .setProperties({ userProperties })
  .setQoS(1)
  .build();
client.send('replace-emoji', record).subscribe(...);
```

> **Hint**`MqttRecordBuilder` class is exported from the `@nestjs/microservices` package.

And you can read these options on the server-side as well, by accessing the `MqttContext`.

JS

```kotlin
@MessagePattern('replace-emoji')
replaceEmoji(@Payload() data: string, @Ctx() context: MqttContext): string {
  const { properties: { userProperties } } = context.getPacket();
  return userProperties['x-version'] === '1.0.0' ? '🐱' : '🐈';
}
```

In some cases you might want to configure user properties for multiple requests, you can pass these options to the `ClientProxyFactory`.

```php
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { ClientProxyFactory, Transport } from '@nestjs/microservices';

@Module({
  providers: [
    {
      provide: 'API_v1',
      useFactory: () =>
        ClientProxyFactory.create({
          transport: Transport.MQTT,
          options: {
            url: 'mqtt://localhost:1833',
            userProperties: { 'x-version': '1.0.0' },
          },
        }),
    },
  ],
})
export class ApiModule {}
```

#### Instance status updates[#](https://docs.nestjs.com/microservices/mqtt#instance-status-updates)

To get real-time updates on the connection and the state of the underlying driver instance, you can subscribe to the `status` stream. This stream provides status updates specific to the chosen driver. For the MQTT driver, the `status` stream emits `connected`, `disconnected`, `reconnecting`, and `closed` events.

```javascript
this.client.status.subscribe((status: MqttStatus) => {
  console.log(status);
});
```

> **Hint** The `MqttStatus` type is imported from the `@nestjs/microservices` package.

Similarly, you can subscribe to the server's `status` stream to receive notifications about the server's status.

```javascript
const server = app.connectMicroservice<MicroserviceOptions>(...);
server.status.subscribe((status: MqttStatus) => {
  console.log(status);
});
```

#### Listening to MQTT events[#](https://docs.nestjs.com/microservices/mqtt#listening-to-mqtt-events)

In some cases, you might want to listen to internal events emitted by the microservice. For example, you could listen for the `error` event to trigger additional operations when an error occurs. To do this, use the `on()` method, as shown below:

```javascript
this.client.on('error', (err) => {
  console.error(err);
});
```

Similarly, you can listen to the server's internal events:

```javascript
server.on<MqttEvents>('error', (err) => {
  console.error(err);
});
```

> **Hint** The `MqttEvents` type is imported from the `@nestjs/microservices` package.

#### Underlying driver access[#](https://docs.nestjs.com/microservices/mqtt#underlying-driver-access)

For more advanced use cases, you may need to access the underlying driver instance. This can be useful for scenarios like manually closing the connection or using driver-specific methods. However, keep in mind that for most cases, you **shouldn't need** to access the driver directly.

To do so, you can use the `unwrap()` method, which returns the underlying driver instance. The generic type parameter should specify the type of driver instance you expect.

```kotlin
const mqttClient = this.client.unwrap<import('mqtt').MqttClient>();
```

Similarly, you can access the server's underlying driver instance:

```go
const mqttClient = server.unwrap<import('mqtt').MqttClient>();
```
