This doc is for instructions to AI coding agents.
Before making any changes to any code, search for its corresponding document within `./` directory. If none exist only then read the library/package versions from `../package.json`, study doc specific for that version from web, then implement the solution based on those docs.

Always use `yarn` as package manager.

To get the idea of what directory structure we use and how we are organizing our code, read the `../README.md` for that.

Use defined import aliases in `tsconfig.json`. If there are directories that are not covered by aliases, create an MD file with pointing out those directories.

Also, to understand the context of what AI agent have done so far, you should go through the `../.conversations` directory.
