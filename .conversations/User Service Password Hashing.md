### User Input

for /users post api, I'm sending following payload:
Payload { email: '', password: '', firstName: '', lastName: '' }
And getting log of password Hash:
passwordHash $argon2id$v=19$m=12288,t=3,p=1$V7Ci476Rb3be38nwWpm7Pw$sUdf3Q7ngN004KHS6A2hLvr6c4NX78/9MuwAHM2q3YE

I want you to assign type of @[/Volumes/Externals/Projects/Running/Creato/agent-for-engineer/server-app/nest/src/users/users.service.ts:L24-L29] and then explain which value to use for storing in password field of User model/table
