### Caching

Caching is a powerful and straightforward **technique** for enhancing your application's performance. By acting as a temporary storage layer, it allows for quicker access to frequently used data, reducing the need to repeatedly fetch or compute the same information. This results in faster response times and improved overall efficiency.

#### Installation[#](https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/caching#installation)

To get started with caching in Nest, you need to install the `@nestjs/cache-manager` package along with the `cache-manager` package.

```ruby
$ npm install @nestjs/cache-manager cache-manager
```

By default, everything is stored in memory; Since `cache-manager` uses [Keyv](https://keyv.org/docs/) under the hood, you can easily switch to a more advanced storage solution, such as Redis, by installing the appropriate package. We'll cover this in more detail later.

#### In-memory cache[#](https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/caching#in-memory-cache)

To enable caching in your application, import the `CacheModule` and configure it using the `register()` method:

```python
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { CacheModule } from '@nestjs/cache-manager';
import { AppController } from './app.controller';

@Module({
  imports: [CacheModule.register()],
  controllers: [AppController],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

This setup initializes in-memory caching with default settings, allowing you to start caching data immediately.

#### Interacting with the Cache store[#](https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/caching#interacting-with-the-cache-store)

To interact with the cache manager instance, inject it to your class using the `CACHE_MANAGER` token, as follows:

```less
constructor(@Inject(CACHE_MANAGER) private cacheManager: Cache) {}
```

> **Hint** The `Cache` class and the `CACHE_MANAGER` token are both imported from the `@nestjs/cache-manager` package.

The `get` method on the `Cache` instance (from the `cache-manager` package) is used to retrieve items from the cache. If the item does not exist in the cache, `null` will be returned.

```csharp
const value = await this.cacheManager.get('key');
```

To add an item to the cache, use the `set` method:

```csharp
await this.cacheManager.set('key', 'value');
```

> **Note** The in-memory cache storage can only store values of types that are supported by [the structured clone algorithm](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Structured_clone_algorithm#javascript_types).

You can manually specify a TTL (expiration time in milliseconds) for this specific key, as follows:

```csharp
await this.cacheManager.set('key', 'value', 1000);
```

Where `1000` is the TTL in milliseconds - in this case, the cache item will expire after one second.

To disable expiration of the cache, set the `ttl` configuration property to `0`:

```csharp
await this.cacheManager.set('key', 'value', 0);
```

To remove an item from the cache, use the `del` method:

```csharp
await this.cacheManager.del('key');
```

To clear the entire cache, use the `clear` method:

```csharp
await this.cacheManager.clear();
```

#### Auto-caching responses[#](https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/caching#auto-caching-responses)

> **Warning** In [GraphQL](https://docs.nestjs.com/graphql/quick-start) applications, interceptors are executed separately for each field resolver. Thus, `CacheModule` (which uses interceptors to cache responses) will not work properly.

To enable auto-caching responses, just tie the `CacheInterceptor` where you want to cache data.

```less
@Controller()
@UseInterceptors(CacheInterceptor)
export class AppController {
  @Get()
  findAll(): string[] {
    return [];
  }
}
```

> **Warning** Only `GET` endpoints are cached. Also, HTTP server routes that inject the native response object (`@Res()`) cannot use the Cache Interceptor. See [response mapping](https://docs.nestjs.com/interceptors#response-mapping) for more details.

To reduce the amount of required boilerplate, you can bind `CacheInterceptor` to all endpoints globally:

```python
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { CacheModule, CacheInterceptor } from '@nestjs/cache-manager';
import { AppController } from './app.controller';
import { APP_INTERCEPTOR } from '@nestjs/core';

@Module({
  imports: [CacheModule.register()],
  controllers: [AppController],
  providers: [
    {
      provide: APP_INTERCEPTOR,
      useClass: CacheInterceptor,
    },
  ],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

#### Time-to-live (TTL)[#](https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/caching#time-to-live-ttl)

The default value for `ttl` is `0`, meaning the cache will never expire. To specify a custom [TTL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_to_live), you can provide the `ttl` option in the `register()` method, as demonstrated below:

```yaml
CacheModule.register({
  ttl: 5000, // milliseconds
});
```

#### Use module globally[#](https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/caching#use-module-globally)

When you want to use `CacheModule` in other modules, you'll need to import it (as is standard with any Nest module). Alternatively, declare it as a [global module](https://docs.nestjs.com/modules#global-modules) by setting the options object's `isGlobal` property to `true`, as shown below. In that case, you will not need to import `CacheModule` in other modules once it's been loaded in the root module (e.g., `AppModule`).

```php
CacheModule.register({
  isGlobal: true,
});
```

#### Global cache overrides[#](https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/caching#global-cache-overrides)

While global cache is enabled, cache entries are stored under a `CacheKey` that is auto-generated based on the route path. You may override certain cache settings (`@CacheKey()` and `@CacheTTL()`) on a per-method basis, allowing customized caching strategies for individual controller methods. This may be most relevant while using [different cache stores.](https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/caching#different-stores)

You can apply the `@CacheTTL()` decorator on a per-controller basis to set a caching TTL for the entire controller. In situations where both controller-level and method-level cache TTL settings are defined, the cache TTL settings specified at the method level will take priority over the ones set at the controller level.

```less
@Controller()
@CacheTTL(50)
export class AppController {
  @CacheKey('custom_key')
  @CacheTTL(20)
  findAll(): string[] {
    return [];
  }
}
```

> **Hint** The `@CacheKey()` and `@CacheTTL()` decorators are imported from the `@nestjs/cache-manager` package.

The `@CacheKey()` decorator may be used with or without a corresponding `@CacheTTL()` decorator and vice versa. One may choose to override only the `@CacheKey()` or only the `@CacheTTL()`. Settings that are not overridden with a decorator will use the default values as registered globally (see [Customize caching](https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/caching#customize-caching)).

#### WebSockets and Microservices[#](https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/caching#websockets-and-microservices)

You can also apply the `CacheInterceptor` to WebSocket subscribers as well as Microservice's patterns (regardless of the transport method that is being used).

JS

```less
@CacheKey('events')
@UseInterceptors(CacheInterceptor)
@SubscribeMessage('events')
handleEvent(client: Client, data: string[]): Observable<string[]> {
  return [];
}
```

However, the additional `@CacheKey()` decorator is required in order to specify a key used to subsequently store and retrieve cached data. Also, please note that you **shouldn't cache everything**. Actions which perform some business operations rather than simply querying the data should never be cached.

Additionally, you may specify a cache expiration time (TTL) by using the `@CacheTTL()` decorator, which will override the global default TTL value.

JS

```less
@CacheTTL(10)
@UseInterceptors(CacheInterceptor)
@SubscribeMessage('events')
handleEvent(client: Client, data: string[]): Observable<string[]> {
  return [];
}
```

> **Hint** The `@CacheTTL()` decorator may be used with or without a corresponding `@CacheKey()` decorator.

#### Adjust tracking[#](https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/caching#adjust-tracking)

By default, Nest uses the request URL (in an HTTP app) or cache key (in websockets and microservices apps, set through the `@CacheKey()` decorator) to associate cache records with your endpoints. Nevertheless, sometimes you might want to set up tracking based on different factors, for example, using HTTP headers (e.g. `Authorization` to properly identify `profile` endpoints).

In order to accomplish that, create a subclass of `CacheInterceptor` and override the `trackBy()` method.

```perl
@Injectable()
class HttpCacheInterceptor extends CacheInterceptor {
  trackBy(context: ExecutionContext): string | undefined {
    return 'key';
  }
}
```

#### Using alternative Cache stores[#](https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/caching#using-alternative-cache-stores)

Switching to a different cache store is straightforward. First, install the appropriate package. For example, to use Redis, install the `@keyv/redis` package:

```ruby
$ npm install @keyv/redis
```

With this in place, you can register the `CacheModule` with multiple stores as shown below:

```python
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { CacheModule } from '@nestjs/cache-manager';
import { AppController } from './app.controller';
import KeyvRedis from '@keyv/redis';
import { Keyv } from 'keyv';
import { CacheableMemory } from 'cacheable';

@Module({
  imports: [
    CacheModule.registerAsync({
      useFactory: async () => {
        return {
          stores: [
            new Keyv({
              store: new CacheableMemory({ ttl: 60000, lruSize: 5000 }),
            }),
            new KeyvRedis('redis://localhost:6379'),
          ],
        };
      },
    }),
  ],
  controllers: [AppController],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

In this example, we've registered two stores: `CacheableMemory` and `KeyvRedis`. The `CacheableMemory` store is a simple in-memory store, while `KeyvRedis` is a Redis store. The `stores` array is used to specify the stores you want to use. The first store in the array is the default store, and the rest are fallback stores.

Check out the [Keyv documentation](https://keyv.org/docs/) for more information on available stores.

#### Async configuration[#](https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/caching#async-configuration)

You may want to asynchronously pass in module options instead of passing them statically at compile time. In this case, use the `registerAsync()` method, which provides several ways to deal with async configuration.

One approach is to use a factory function:

```css
CacheModule.registerAsync({
  useFactory: () => ({
    ttl: 5,
  }),
});
```

Our factory behaves like all other asynchronous module factories (it can be `async` and is able to inject dependencies through `inject`).

```css
CacheModule.registerAsync({
  imports: [ConfigModule],
  useFactory: async (configService: ConfigService) => ({
    ttl: configService.get('CACHE_TTL'),
  }),
  inject: [ConfigService],
});
```

Alternatively, you can use the `useClass` method:

```css
CacheModule.registerAsync({
  useClass: CacheConfigService,
});
```

The above construction will instantiate `CacheConfigService` inside `CacheModule` and will use it to get the options object. The `CacheConfigService` has to implement the `CacheOptionsFactory` interface in order to provide the configuration options:

```perl
@Injectable()
class CacheConfigService implements CacheOptionsFactory {
  createCacheOptions(): CacheModuleOptions {
    return {
      ttl: 5,
    };
  }
}
```

If you wish to use an existing configuration provider imported from a different module, use the `useExisting` syntax:

```php
CacheModule.registerAsync({
  imports: [ConfigModule],
  useExisting: ConfigService,
});
```

This works the same as `useClass` with one critical difference - `CacheModule` will lookup imported modules to reuse any already-created `ConfigService`, instead of instantiating its own.

> **Hint**`CacheModule#register`, `CacheModule#registerAsync` and `CacheOptionsFactory` have an optional generic (type argument) to narrow down store-specific configuration options, making it type safe.

You can also pass so-called `extraProviders` to the `registerAsync()` method. These providers will be merged with the module providers.

```php
CacheModule.registerAsync({
  imports: [ConfigModule],
  useClass: ConfigService,
  extraProviders: [MyAdditionalProvider],
});
```

This is useful when you want to provide additional dependencies to the factory function or the class constructor.
