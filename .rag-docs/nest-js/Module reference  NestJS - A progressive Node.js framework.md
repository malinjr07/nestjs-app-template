### Module reference

Nest provides the `ModuleRef` class to navigate the internal list of providers and obtain a reference to any provider using its injection token as a lookup key. The `ModuleRef` class also provides a way to dynamically instantiate both static and scoped providers. `ModuleRef` can be injected into a class in the normal way:

cats.service.ts

JS

```perl
@Injectable()
export class CatsService {
  constructor(private moduleRef: ModuleRef) {}
}
```

> **Hint** The `ModuleRef` class is imported from the `@nestjs/core` package.

#### Retrieving instances[#](https://docs.nestjs.com/fundamentals/module-ref#retrieving-instances)

The `ModuleRef` instance (hereafter we'll refer to it as the **module reference**) has a `get()` method. By default, this method returns a provider, controller, or injectable (e.g., guard, interceptor, etc.) that was registered and has been instantiated in the _current module_ using its injection token/class name. If the instance is not found, an exception will be raised.

cats.service.ts

JS

```kotlin
@Injectable()
export class CatsService implements OnModuleInit {
  private service: Service;
  constructor(private moduleRef: ModuleRef) {}

  onModuleInit() {
    this.service = this.moduleRef.get(Service);
  }
}
```

> **Warning** You can't retrieve scoped providers (transient or request-scoped) with the `get()` method. Instead, use the technique described [below](https://docs.nestjs.com/fundamentals/module-ref#resolving-scoped-providers). Learn how to control scopes [here](https://docs.nestjs.com/fundamentals/injection-scopes).

To retrieve a provider from the global context (for example, if the provider has been injected in a different module), pass the `{ strict: false }` option as a second argument to `get()`.

```kotlin
this.moduleRef.get(Service, { strict: false });
```

#### Resolving scoped providers[#](https://docs.nestjs.com/fundamentals/module-ref#resolving-scoped-providers)

To dynamically resolve a scoped provider (transient or request-scoped), use the `resolve()` method, passing the provider's injection token as an argument.

cats.service.ts

JS

```typescript
@Injectable()
export class CatsService implements OnModuleInit {
  private transientService: TransientService;
  constructor(private moduleRef: ModuleRef) {}

  async onModuleInit() {
    this.transientService = await this.moduleRef.resolve(TransientService);
  }
}
```

The `resolve()` method returns a unique instance of the provider, from its own **DI container sub-tree**. Each sub-tree has a unique **context identifier**. Thus, if you call this method more than once and compare instance references, you will see that they are not equal.

cats.service.ts

JS

```typescript
@Injectable()
export class CatsService implements OnModuleInit {
  constructor(private moduleRef: ModuleRef) {}

  async onModuleInit() {
    const transientServices = await Promise.all([
      this.moduleRef.resolve(TransientService),
      this.moduleRef.resolve(TransientService),
    ]);
    console.log(transientServices[0] === transientServices[1]); // false
  }
}
```

To generate a single instance across multiple `resolve()` calls, and ensure they share the same generated DI container sub-tree, you can pass a context identifier to the `resolve()` method. Use the `ContextIdFactory` class to generate a context identifier. This class provides a `create()` method that returns an appropriate unique identifier.

cats.service.ts

JS

```typescript
@Injectable()
export class CatsService implements OnModuleInit {
  constructor(private moduleRef: ModuleRef) {}

  async onModuleInit() {
    const contextId = ContextIdFactory.create();
    const transientServices = await Promise.all([
      this.moduleRef.resolve(TransientService, contextId),
      this.moduleRef.resolve(TransientService, contextId),
    ]);
    console.log(transientServices[0] === transientServices[1]); // true
  }
}
```

> **Hint** The `ContextIdFactory` class is imported from the `@nestjs/core` package.

#### Registering `REQUEST` provider[#](https://docs.nestjs.com/fundamentals/module-ref#registering-request-provider)

Manually generated context identifiers (with `ContextIdFactory.create()`) represent DI sub-trees in which `REQUEST` provider is `undefined` as they are not instantiated and managed by the Nest dependency injection system.

To register a custom `REQUEST` object for a manually created DI sub-tree, use the `ModuleRef#registerRequestByContextId()` method, as follows:

```kotlin
const contextId = ContextIdFactory.create();
this.moduleRef.registerRequestByContextId(/* YOUR_REQUEST_OBJECT */, contextId);
```

#### Getting current sub-tree[#](https://docs.nestjs.com/fundamentals/module-ref#getting-current-sub-tree)

Occasionally, you may want to resolve an instance of a request-scoped provider within a **request context**. Let's say that `CatsService` is request-scoped and you want to resolve the `CatsRepository` instance which is also marked as a request-scoped provider. In order to share the same DI container sub-tree, you must obtain the current context identifier instead of generating a new one (e.g., with the `ContextIdFactory.create()` function, as shown above). To obtain the current context identifier, start by injecting the request object using `@Inject()` decorator.

cats.service.ts

JS

```less
@Injectable()
export class CatsService {
  constructor(
    @Inject(REQUEST) private request: Record<string, unknown>,
  ) {}
}
```

> **Hint** Learn more about the request provider [here](https://docs.nestjs.com/fundamentals/injection-scopes#request-provider).

Now, use the `getByRequest()` method of the `ContextIdFactory` class to create a context id based on the request object, and pass this to the `resolve()` call:

```kotlin
const contextId = ContextIdFactory.getByRequest(this.request);
const catsRepository = await this.moduleRef.resolve(CatsRepository, contextId);
```

#### Instantiating custom classes dynamically[#](https://docs.nestjs.com/fundamentals/module-ref#instantiating-custom-classes-dynamically)

To dynamically instantiate a class that **wasn't previously registered** as a **provider**, use the module reference's `create()` method.

cats.service.ts

JS

```typescript
@Injectable()
export class CatsService implements OnModuleInit {
  private catsFactory: CatsFactory;
  constructor(private moduleRef: ModuleRef) {}

  async onModuleInit() {
    this.catsFactory = await this.moduleRef.create(CatsFactory);
  }
}
```

This technique enables you to conditionally instantiate different classes outside of the framework container.
